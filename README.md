Recipe Sharing Site
Here, users can create and share their personal favorite recipes, as well as look at recipes that other users have posted themsleves

How It's Made:
Tech used: REACT, Redux, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, MongoDB, Express

This app was creating using the MERN stack, usernames and passwords are saved under the user collection on MongoDB (passwords saved with bcrypt). Recipes are saved in Mongodb, saving images for recipes is done using clarifai. There is a personal feed as well as a public feed for users, recipes can be viewed through both of these (personal is only the logged in users recipes).

Optimizations:
I would like to be able to fix up the CSS files on this project, about halfway through I found a better looking way to manage my css files for components. Right now the CSS is a bit of a mess but the project is still functioning just fine. Other future optimizations would be profile pictures for users, the ability to like other posts in the feed, and being able to set your posts to private if you do not wish for others to see them. I would also like to find a better way to have the instructions and ingredients formatted on the form, so that users do not have to press enter themselves on the textarea.

Lessons Learned:
Trying to get the posts to function properly and format correctly was slightly difficult for me. The feed vs. personal posts was a struggle to get through but I learned over time how to properly word my google searches/ filter through what I need to read through on stackoverflow. I learned that stackoverflow is a great, great friend to have.
