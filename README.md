Recipe Sharing Site

Here, users can create and share their personal favorite recipes, as well as look at recipes that other users have posted themsleves

How It's Made:
Tech used: REACT, Redux, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, MongoDB, Express

This app was created using the MERN stack, usernames and passwords are saved under the user collection on MongoDB (passwords saved with bcrypt). Recipes are saved in Mongodb, saving images for recipes is done using clarifai. There is a personal feed as well as a public feed for users, recipes can be viewed through both of these (personal is only the logged in users recipes).

Optimizations:
I would like for users to be able to like/ dislike every recipe they come across on the site. Being able to follow users and only see the recipes of who you are following is another feature that I would like to see adde to this project as well.

Lessons Learned:
My biggest hurdle with this project was getting the posts to properly update. The feed vs. personal posts was a struggle to get through but I learned over time how to properly word my google searches/ filter through what I need to read through on stackoverflow. I learned that stackoverflow is a great, great friend to have.
